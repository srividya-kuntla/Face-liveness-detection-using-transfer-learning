Transfer Learning for Image Classification on Kaggle Dataset This repository contains a Jupyter notebook implementing Transfer Learning to perform image classification on a Kaggle dataset.

Project Overview
Transfer learning is a popular deep learning technique where a pre-trained model is used as a starting point for a task on a new dataset. In this project, a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) is fine-tuned to classify images from a Kaggle dataset. The model leverages the knowledge gained from large-scale datasets like ImageNet to perform well even with a smaller training dataset.

Key Features

Pre-trained Models: Use of pre-trained CNN models like ResNet, VGG, or Inception (depending on the notebook implementation) for efficient training.

Fine-tuning and Feature Extraction: Demonstrates two approaches: fine-tuning specific layers of the pre-trained model or using the model for feature extraction and training a custom classifier.

Keras/TensorFlow: Built using the Keras and TensorFlow frameworks for easy customization and experimentation.

Performance Metrics: Includes accuracy, loss tracking, and other performance metrics such as confusion matrices to evaluate the model.
